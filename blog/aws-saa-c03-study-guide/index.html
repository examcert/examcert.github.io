<h1>How I'd Study for the AWS SAA-C03 If I Had to Start Over</h1>
<div class="meta">Published February 9, 2026 · 6 min read</div>

<p>The AWS Solutions Architect Associate is probably the most popular cloud certification out there. And for good reason — it opens doors, it pays well, and it forces you to actually understand how AWS services fit together. But there's a lot of bad advice floating around about how to prepare for it.</p>

<p>I've seen people spend six months studying for this exam. I've also seen people pass it in three weeks. The difference isn't intelligence — it's knowing what to focus on and what to skip.</p>

<h2>What the SAA-C03 Actually Tests</h2>

<p>Let's get the basics out of the way. The SAA-C03 has <strong>65 questions</strong>, and you get <strong>130 minutes</strong> to finish. The passing score is <strong>720 out of 1000</strong>. It costs <strong>$150 USD</strong>. You can take it at a Pearson VUE center or online from home.</p>

<p>The exam breaks down into four domains:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures (30%)</strong> — IAM policies, encryption, VPC security, network segmentation</li>
<li><strong>Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures (26%)</strong> — Multi-AZ deployments, auto scaling, disaster recovery strategies</li>
<li><strong>Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures (24%)</strong> — Choosing the right database, caching, CDN, compute options</li>
<li><strong>Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures (20%)</strong> — Reserved vs. Spot vs. On-Demand, storage tiers, right-sizing</li>
</ul>

<p>That first domain is the big one. Security alone is almost a third of your score. If you don't know IAM inside and out, you're going to have a rough time.</p>

<h2>The Services That Actually Matter</h2>

<p>AWS has over 200 services. The SAA-C03 cares about maybe 30 of them deeply, and another 20 at a surface level. Here's where I'd spend my time:</p>

<h3>Must-Know Cold</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EC2</strong> — Instance types, placement groups, pricing models. Know the difference between Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances.</li>
<li><strong>S3</strong> — Storage classes (Standard, IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive), lifecycle policies, versioning, cross-region replication</li>
<li><strong>VPC</strong> — Subnets, route tables, NACLs vs security groups, NAT gateways, VPC peering, Transit Gateway</li>
<li><strong>RDS</strong> — Multi-AZ vs Read Replicas, Aurora specifics, automated backups</li>
<li><strong>IAM</strong> — Policies, roles, cross-account access, identity federation</li>
<li><strong>ELB</strong> — ALB vs NLB vs Gateway LB, health checks, sticky sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Know Well Enough</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, EventBridge</strong> — serverless patterns come up a lot</li>
<li><strong>DynamoDB</strong> — partition keys, GSIs, DAX caching, on-demand vs provisioned</li>
<li><strong>CloudFront</strong> — origin access, signed URLs, Lambda@Edge</li>
<li><strong>EFS vs FSx</strong> — when to use which file system</li>
<li><strong>KMS, Secrets Manager, ACM</strong> — encryption at rest and in transit</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to know every single parameter. But you need to know <em>when</em> to pick each service. That's the whole point of being a solutions architect.</p>

<h2>My Study Plan (If I Started From Scratch)</h2>

<p><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Go through a structured video course. I don't care which one — Stephane Maarek, Adrian Cantrill, or the official AWS Skill Builder. Pick one and stick with it. Don't watch two courses. That's a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Start doing practice exams. This is where the real learning happens. Every wrong answer teaches you something a video never will. I'd recommend hitting up <a href="https://www.examcert.app/exams/aws-saa-c03/">ExamCert</a> for free practice questions — they cover all four domains and the explanations are genuinely helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Review your weak areas. If you keep getting VPC questions wrong, go back and lab it out. Spin up a VPC from scratch — subnets, route tables, internet gateway, NAT gateway, the whole thing. Nothing beats hands-on experience.</p>

<blockquote>Hot take: Reading whitepapers is overrated for this exam. The Well-Architected Framework whitepaper is worth skimming, but don't burn a whole week on documentation. Practice questions are a better use of your time.</blockquote>

<h2>Common Traps on the Exam</h2>

<p>AWS loves to test your ability to pick the <em>most</em> cost-effective or <em>most</em> operationally efficient solution. Here are patterns I've seen trip people up:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>"Least operational overhead"</strong> usually means managed services. If the answer choices include managing your own EC2 cluster vs. using a fully managed service, go with managed. Every time.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region</strong> — Multi-AZ is for high availability within a region. Multi-Region is for disaster recovery across regions. Know the difference.</li>
<li><strong>S3 storage class questions</strong> — They love asking about moving data between tiers. Remember: S3 Intelligent-Tiering exists and it's often the right answer when access patterns are unpredictable.</li>
<li><strong>SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge</strong> — SQS is for decoupling with queues. SNS is for fan-out (one message to many subscribers). EventBridge is for event-driven routing with filtering rules.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Is the SAA-C03 Worth It in 2026?</h2>

<p>Honestly? Yes. Despite what some people say about certifications being "just paper," the SAA-C03 carries real weight. It's the most recognized cloud cert globally. Recruiters filter for it. Hiring managers respect it. And the knowledge you gain studying for it is practical — you'll actually use it on the job.</p>

<p>The ROI is hard to beat. $150 for the exam, maybe $30-50 for study materials (or free if you use resources like <a href="https://www.examcert.app/exams/aws-saa-c03/">ExamCert</a>), and a few weeks of focused study. Compare that to a bootcamp that costs $15,000 and takes three months.</p>

<p>One thing though — don't stop at the cert. Build something on AWS after you pass. Deploy a real application. Set up a CI/CD pipeline. The certification gets you in the door; the hands-on skills keep you there.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The SAA-C03 isn't easy, but it's not the monster some people make it out to be. Focus on the high-weight domains (security and resilience are over half the exam), do a ton of practice questions, and don't overthink it. Four weeks of solid, focused study is enough for most people with some cloud background.</p>

<p>If you're brand new to AWS, give yourself six to eight weeks. No shame in that. The point is to actually learn the material, not just memorize answers.</p>

<p>Good luck. You've got this.</p>
