<h1>Everything You've Heard About the CCSP Is Wrong — Here's What the Exam Is Really Like</h1>
<div class="meta">Published February 22, 2026 · 8 min read</div>

<p><em>"The CCSP is just a cloud version of the CISSP."</em> Wrong.</p>
<p><em>"If you passed the CISSP, the CCSP will be easy."</em> Very wrong.</p>
<p><em>"The CCSP is easier because it's narrower."</em> Hilariously wrong.</p>

<p>I've passed both, and the CCSP surprised me more than any cert I've ever taken. Here's what nobody tells you about this exam — and how to actually prepare for it.</p>

<h2>Myth 1: "It's Just CISSP But For Cloud"</h2>
<p>The CISSP is a mile wide and an inch deep. The CCSP is a half-mile wide and <strong>three inches deep</strong> on cloud-specific topics. The overlap between the two exams is only <strong>25-30%</strong>.</p>
<p>The CCSP dives deep into cloud architecture models, cloud data lifecycle, virtualization security, and cloud-specific legal frameworks that the CISSP barely touches. Thinking of it as "CISSP-lite for cloud" will get you a failing score.</p>

<h2>Myth 2: "CISSP Holders Breeze Through It"</h2>
<p>Approximately <strong>32% of candidates pass on their first attempt</strong>. CISSP holders consistently struggle on three domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain 1: Cloud Concepts, Architecture and Design</strong> — cloud reference architecture, shared responsibility models, and cloud deployment specifics go far beyond CISSP coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Domain 2: Cloud Data Security</strong> — data lifecycle management, encryption in multi-tenant environments, and cloud-specific DLP strategies are entirely new territory.</li>
<li><strong>Domain 3: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure Security</strong> — hypervisor security, virtual network segmentation, and container orchestration security aren't covered in CISSP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a CISSP is helpful — but it's not a shortcut.</p>

<h2>Myth 3: "The CCSP Is Easier Because It Has Fewer Domains"</h2>
<p>Six domains vs. eight — but <strong>domain count does not equal difficulty</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain 2 (Cloud Data Security, 20%)</strong> is the largest and most technical domain. It covers data classification, encryption, tokenization, masking, data retention, and deletion across cloud environments.</li>
<li><strong>Domain 6 (Legal, Risk and Compliance, 13%)</strong> is the most conceptually dense. International privacy regulations, cloud contracts, audit requirements, and jurisdictional issues make this domain uniquely challenging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fewer domains means each one carries more weight. You can't afford to be weak in any of them.</p>

<h2>What Actually Works for CCSP Prep</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the (ISC)² CCSP CBK</strong> — especially the cloud data security and legal/compliance chapters. This is your primary source of truth.</li>
<li><strong>Spend 40% of your study time on Domains 2 and 6</strong> — these two domains account for 33% of the exam and trip up the most candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Use scenario-based practice questions</strong> — the CCSP tests your ability to apply concepts, not just recall them. <a href="https://www.examcert.app/exams/ccsp/">CCSP practice questions on ExamCert</a> — $4.99 lifetime access with a pass-or-refund guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Study for at least 8 weeks</strong> — even with cloud experience, you need time to internalize the (ISC)² perspective on cloud security.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Should You Get the CCSP?</h2>
<p>If you work in cloud security: <strong>yes</strong>. The cloud security market is projected to hit <strong>$77 billion by 2027</strong>, and the CCSP is the gold standard credential for cloud security professionals.</p>
<p>If you're choosing between the CCSP and CISSP: <strong>get the CISSP first</strong>. It's more broadly recognized, and the foundational knowledge will make your CCSP preparation smoother. Then add the CCSP to specialize.</p>
